## UX

### Function
This project is for prospective employers, recruiters, clients and Code Institute markers. These 4 user types will want to achieve 2 major goals. Firstly, the prospective employers, recruiters and clients will want to identify if I have the capabilities required for their needs. Code Institute markers will want to identify if I have the build the website according to their project specifications. This project will satisfy both as the content and pages of the project clearly showcase my capabilities as a developer and the way the project was built will show Code Institute markers the project was built according to specification.

### Styling

This website was built with speed and simplicity in mind. Hence background radial gradients where selected for the header and footer for a clean an cool colouring using the colour blue (rather than background-images). The background gradient was generated using [WebGradients](https://webgradients.com/) and the colour palette was generated using [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to find complimentary colours for the website.

The fonts used are Hind Vadodara and Mitr using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and imported to the style.css file.

### User Stories

### Mockups
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

### Languages

-	To display content on each HTML page and enable the use of more semantic elements used in HTML5
>	CSS / CSS3

>	JavaScript
-	To make HTML content more dynamic and to enable features that are supported by Bootstrap

### Libraries
>	Bootstrap
-	To speed up the building of the project using font end framework that has been tied and tested
>	Font Awesome
-   To make the project more visually appealing to users through the use of icons
>	W3Schools
-	The timeline used in the skills and experience pages are based on a timeline obtained from W3Schools
>	Google Fonts

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
