## UX

### Function
This project is for prospective employers, recruiters, clients and Code Institute markers. These 4 user types will want to achieve 2 major goals. Firstly, the prospective employers, recruiters and clients will want to identify if I have the capabilities required for their needs. Code Institute markers will want to identify if I have the build the website according to their project specifications. This project will satisfy both as the content and pages of the project clearly showcase my capabilities as a developer and the way the project was built will show Code Institute markers the project was built according to specification.

### Styling

This website was built with speed and simplicity in mind. Hence background radial gradients were selected for the header and footer for a clean a cool colouring using the colour blue (rather than background-images). The background gradient was generated using [WebGradients](https://webgradients.com/) and the colour palette was generated using [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to find complementary colours for the website.

The fonts used are Hind Vadodara and Mitr using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and imported to the style.css file.
