# Ferenc Kovacs Resume

This project is to showcase a basic profile website of me as a developer by displaying information on my work history, skills, experience, about me section and contact page.

As I continue to develop professionally my profile will be updated occasionally.

## UX

### Function
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Styling

This website was built with speed and simplicity in mind. Hence background radial gradients where selected for the header and footer for a clean an cool colouring using the colour blue (rather than background-images). The background gradient was generated using WebGradients and the colour palette was generated using ColorSpace to find complimentary colours for the website.

The fonts used are Hind Vadodara and Mitr using Google Fonts and imported to the style.css file.

### Pages

#### About Me
#### Experience
#### Skills
#### Portfolio
#### Contact

### User Stories
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

### Mockups
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

### Languages
>	HTML / HTML5
-	To display content on each HTML page and enable the use of more semantic elements used in HTML5
>	CSS / CSS3
-	To style content in each HTML page and enable additional styling features by using CSS3
>	JavaScript
-	To make HTML content more dynamic and to enable features that are supported by Bootstrap

### Libraries
>	Bootstrap
-	To speed up the building of the project using font end framework that has been tied and tested
>	Font Awesome
-   To make the project more visually appealing to users through the use of icons
>	W3Schools
-	The timeline used in the skills and experience pages are based on a timeline obtained from W3Schools
>	Google Fonts
-	To make enable custom fonts to be used in the project. Hind Vadodara and Mitr were selected
>	jQuery
-	To simplify Dom manipulation and to enable Bootstrap features



## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
